## :triangular_flag_on_post: Application demo

You can test the project at this url: [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).
As this is a backend application, you will need to use an http client like Insomnia or Postman to test the API calls
Click here to get the Insomnia file and try it out.

#### :cloud: Cloud infrastructure

## :computer: Getting started

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

Npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.
- [Node.js v16.14.2](https://nodejs.org/) or heigher.

Yarn is a package manager created by the Facebook team and seems to be faster than npm in general.
- [Yarn v1.22.5](https://yarnpkg.com/) or heigher.

<!-- As mentioned before, we are using Apache Kafka to handle the communication between the services and Postgres to the database, and the best way to run these environments locally is using Docker, for that you will need to have it installed on your machine. [Click here to install Docker](https://www.notion.so/Docker-e-Docker-Compose-16771f2ceefe4a05a8c29df4ca49e97a). -->

<!-- The project can be built directly with the Docker and Docker Compose, where the server container will be created with all the necessary configurations to start the project. [Click here to install Docker and Docker Compose](https://www.notion.so/Docker-e-Docker-Compose-16771f2ceefe4a05a8c29df4ca49e97a). -->

Also, itâ€™s good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
